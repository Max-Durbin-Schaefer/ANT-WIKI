# [Ant WIKI](ANTWIKI.md), Editing Ant WIKI

- Ant WIKI is a folder of hyperlinked notes about ant.

- notes are written in markdown

- The file tree reflects the hierarchy of systems and concepts of ant where subsystems are nested. 

***Sub-folders*** representing subsystems or concepts should have a landing page named closely after the folder. This is so that editors can link to general concepts.
these landing pages should...

    - link to their parent directory's landing page
    - summarize their folder while linking to sibling files
    - not have spaces in their name
    - what would re-factorization look like as all links are hard coded? should there be some kind of config file? will I address this before it's to late? lol nope

Allot of what is said here is going to be wrong, hopefully as it progresses wrong things are corrected.

Locations should be searchable, can I create a hotkey where you can highlight a location and it overlays a little info about that location. That would be useful
