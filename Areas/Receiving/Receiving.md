(also see [Receiving(Process)](/Receiving/Receiving.md))

The Receiving Aea (F01 in VISU) is where the main processes of receiving happens, however the pallet loop is also used by other processes like replenishment etc. 

Receiving includes part of the pallet loop which a pallet may be on for processes unrelated to the receiving process like replenishing De-Layering/De-Trash or it could be going to shipping as a shipper pallet. A pallet could also be storing after replenishment is complete. The area is used to move stock involved in many processes other than the Receiving(WarehouseFunction) Process.

The sub-areas of Receiving are..
- the pallet loop
- teach in stations (teach in process)
- Wrappers
- Pallet Stacker
- Exchangers
- Induction points (induction process)
- Pallet Hospital
