While partially located in Receiving the pallet loop is used outside of the Receiving process for each general function of ant.

(include significant locations of the pallet loop)

(draw the specific locations and also include the general flow of conveyors)

Wrappers


Receiving includes part of the pallet loop which a pallet may be on for processes unrelated to the receiving process like replenishing De-Layering/De-Trash or it could be going to shipping as a shipper pallet. A pallet could also be storing after replenishment is complete. The area is used to move stock involved in many processes other than the Receiving(WarehouseFunction) Process.




processes described in [Receiving(WarehouseFunction)](/Receiving/Receiving.md).
